# James Glenn

I'm currently a Software Engineering bootcamp student at Makers. Previously I was a finance professional that helped to build Monzo, a £1.4bn valued FinTech and the UK’s fastest growing bank. I worked as the sole Finance Projects Analyst, tasked with ensuring that the Finance function remained focused on automation and controls as the company rapidly scaled from 1.9m customers to over 4.2m and grew from ~900 employees to over 1,500.

This is backed with over four years of finance & accounting experience in public infrastructure (energy & social PFI/PPP) investments for a leading FTSE250 fund and in commercial real estate acquisition for a global private equity fund, on behalf of the Qatari Royal Family.

During my time in Finance I've covered a wide range of functions including: Accounts Payable & Receivable, Systems Accounting, Project Accounting, Financial Controls and most recently in Treasury. I combine this experience with skills gained in project management and change implementation to bring stakeholder visions into reality by delivering tangible & effective results in an efficient time frame.

I initially discovered a love for programming from teaching myself Python, in order to automate in-house manual processes. Then after gaining further development experience, and from working with Engineering & Data teams at Monzo, this really just confirmed for me that Software Engineering was the career I wanted to pursue. I've made a commitment to achieving this ambition by joining Makers as a full-time student.

## Experience

**Monzo Bank** | May 2019 - July 2020  
**Finance Projects Analyst**

Monzo was founded in 2015 and is recognised by the iconic _'Hot Coral'_ card. The bank has rapidly grown from just another Shoreditch startup to achieving the "quickest crowd-funding campaign in history", reaching 'Unicorn' status, a US launch and even at one point a valuation of £2bn. It's changing the way banking is done through its branch-less approach and offers customers current, joint, teen, business, premium and savings accounts, ISAs, loans and overdrafts.

- Built an automated global Balance Sheet Substantiation (BSS) & full reconciliation process using SQL, BigQuery and Google Apps Script. Achieving an 100% account attestation in four working days for ~200 general ledger accounts. I saved the firm on the significant cost of purchasing a third-party BSS system by single-handedly building the tool in-house, in under a month.

- Cut processing time from 2 working days to 2 hours and significantly reduced manual errors by automating the upload of third-party expense card data. Achieved by deploying an ETL backend Python service to send API requests, map the data using Pandas and then prepare a NetSuite Journal which could be passed to a Golang service using a RPC.

- Achieved further time savings by automating the quarterly intraday liquidity returns for the bank. Coordinating with the Regulatory, Engineering and Data team to consolidate multiple payment schemes using SQL, BigQuery and dbt. Reducing the process from four working days to half a day.
